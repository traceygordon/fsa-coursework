//   Which of the following statements is true about the car object?

// A. car.start() and car.honk() will both throw an error because they are not valid object properties.
// B. car.brand will return "Toyota", and car.honk() will return "Beep beep!".
// C. car.year is a method of the car object.
// D. The syntax for defining the honk method is incorrect because it does not use the function keyword.
