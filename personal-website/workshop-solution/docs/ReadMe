# my-personal-website
## Overview
I create a simple personal website highlighting my knowledge of HTML, CSS and JS.

## HTML
I created a navigation bar at the top of the page so the uder could move through the pages with ease. I used tables to create order and flow to each page on the website.

I jazzed up the footer with functioning social media buttons.

## CSS
I created a cohesive color scheme that is carried throughout the website along with borders.

## JS
I created a console.log with the notification "Hello, World!"
